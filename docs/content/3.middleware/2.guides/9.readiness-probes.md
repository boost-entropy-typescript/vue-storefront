## Readiness probes

Users of Alokai Cloud have their middleware deployed in Kubernetes. Readiness probes allow an application to temporarily mark itself as unable to serve requests in a Kubernetes cluster. 

As of version 5.0.0 of the `@vue-storefront/middleware` package, you can launch the middleware and send a GET request to the `http://localhost:4000/readyz` endpoint. The response will contain either a success message or a list of errors describing why the readiness probe failed. 

The same endpoint is queried automatically by Alokai Cloud every few seconds to check whether requests should be routed to a particular middleware replica. One such case is if a middleware instance is being killed (if it receives a `SIGTERM` signal), it should stop accepting traffic, but wait a few seconds before shutting down to handle any requests that are still being handledby that instance.

You can read more about Kubernetes readiness probes in the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-readiness-probes).



### Adding custom readiness probes

To add custom readiness probes, pass them to the `readinessProbes` property when calling `createServer`.

```ts
const customReadinessProbe = async () => { 
  const dependentServiceRunning = await axios.get('http://someservice:3000/healthz');
  if(dependentServiceRunning.status !== 200) {
    throw new Error('Service that the middleware depends on is offline. The middleware is temporarily not ready to accept connections.')
  }
}
const app = await createServer(config, { readinessProbes: [customReadinessProbe]});
```

In order for custom readiness probes to be implemented correctly, they need to do two things:
1. they must all be async or return a promise (the return value is not checked, it's expected to be void/undefined)
2. they must all throw an exception when you want a readiness probe to fail
